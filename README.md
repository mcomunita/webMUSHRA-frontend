## Introduction

Listening tests are widely used to assess the quality of audio systems. In the last few years, conducting listening experiments over the Internet, as so called web-based experiments, has become popular. Until now, it was only possible to implement a limited number of listening test types as web-based experiments because web standards were missing some crucial features, e.g. sample manipulation of audio streams. MUSHRA tests are designed to compare the audio quality of several test conditions with intermediate impairments to a high quality reference. With the rise of [Web Audio API](http://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/), for the first time MUSHRA experiments can be carried out within the web browser while at the same time being compliant to the ITU-R Recommendation BS.1534 (MUSHRA).

## Experiment configuration

webMUSHRA uses [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) to configure experiments. 

A simple MUSHRA test in YAML looks like this:

```yaml
pages:
  - type: mushra
    id: Item 1
    name: Orchestra
    content: Add additional notes for the participants
    showWaveform: true
    reference: reference.wav
    createAnchor35: true
    createAnchor70: true
    stimuli:
      C1: codec1.wav
      C2: codec2.wav
      C3: codec3.wav
```

The specific parameters are described in the [Experimenters Manual](doc/experimenter.md).


## Run Locally using PHP's builtin webserver

1. Download or clone repo:

```bash
cd path/to/parent/folder
git clone https://github.com/mcomunita/webMUSHRA-frontend.git
```

2. Install PHP

MacOS:
```bash
brew update
brew install php
php -v
```

Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install php
php -v
```

1. Start PHP development server

MacOS/Linux:
```bash
cd /path/to/webMUSHRA/folder
php -S localhost:8000
```

4. Access webMUSHRA: open a browser and go to http://localhost:8000 (or other chosen port number).

5. Choose experiment: experiment configurations are stored in the `configs/` folder. To load a configuration/experiment, specify the `/?config=test_config.yaml` argument in the url (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/?config=mushra_nowav.yaml`). If no argument is specified `configs/default.yaml` is loaded.

6. Define new experiment: see `doc/experimenter.md` for documentation on how to configure a `.yaml` file for a new experiment.
7. Save results locally: a PHP script is available in `service/write.php` to save results in the `results` folder. Just make sure to specify `remoteService: service/write.php` in the experiment config file.



## Run Online - Frontend (GitHub Pages) + Backend (Render) + Persistent Storage (Amazon S3)

To run webMUSHRA online it is necessary to:

* Deploy the frontend (i.e., web app) to a web host to run the user interface. GitHub Pages is free and easy to use.
* Deploy the backend (i.e., web server) to a cloud application platform to save the results. Render is free and easy to use. Heroku is also a valid alternative.
* Setup a cloud storage service to have a persistent storage of the results. We make use of Amazon S3. Google Cloud Storage is also a valid alternative.

:warning: Keep both frontend and backend repositories private

## Getting started: Setting up webMUSHRA using PHP's builtin webserver

To load audio files and save the results as csv text files, webMUSHRA needs to run on a web server. If you already have `php` installed on your system (for example on Mac OS X), you can run a php development server on port 8000 from the terminal using `php -S localhost:8000`.

Now you can run webMUSHRA using the following URL: http://localhost:8000

The experiment configurations are stored in the `configs/` folder. To load a configuration/experiment, specify the `config` argument in the url http://localhost:8000/?config=mushra_showresults.yaml. `configs/default.yaml` is the configuration loaded when no config is specified.

### Docker

You can use docker to set up webMUSHRA quickly. Just run
`docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build` to build the webMUSHRA docker container.

To run the container use webMUSHRA `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up`. We configured the docker image so that the `configs` and the `results` folder is mounted inside the container so that you can modify it on the fly and receive results within the `results` folder.

#### Note for Docker on Windows

When using Docker Toolbox/Machine on Windows, volume paths (to mount the `configs` and `results` folder) are not converted by default. To enable this conversion set the environment variable COMPOSE_CONVERT_WINDOWS_PATHS=1 e.g. by `env:COMPOSE_CONVERT_WINDOWS_PATHS=1` in the power shell.

### Apache + PHP
Another custom way to run webMUSHRA would be to install a complete web server stack like [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).

### Python Backend
A python based backend to save the results in provided by [pymushra](https://github.com/nils-werner/pymushra).

#### Change or add a configuration

webMUSHRA uses [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) to configure experiments. Since YAML is using whitespace indentation (no tab characters!), we recommend to use a text editor like [Atom](http://atom.io) that ships with YAML support.

A simple MUSHRA test in YAML looks like this:

```yaml
pages:
  - type: mushra
    id: Item 1
    name: Orchestra
    content: Add additional notes for the participants
    showWaveform: true
    reference: reference.wav
    createAnchor35: true
    createAnchor70: true
    stimuli:
      C1: codec1.wav
      C2: codec2.wav
      C3: codec3.wav
```

The specific parameters are described in the [Experimenters Manual](doc/experimenter.md).
